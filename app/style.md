NimdeQuizzer | System Directives & Style Guide0. STRICT AGENT DIRECTIVES: COMPONENT ARCHITECTURECRITICAL: These rules govern all code generation and component structuring. There is zero room for guesswork or hallucination. You MUST adhere to the following workflow before writing any new UI code.RULE 1: STRICT REUSE (NO DUPLICATION)Always search the existing components/ui and components/shared directories before creating a new component.Do NOT build a new component if an existing one can achieve the same result via props (e.g., passing a variant="outline" prop instead of building a new OutlineButton).RULE 2: ZERO GUESSWORKIf the design requirements for a component are ambiguous, you MUST stop and ask for explicit clarification. Do not invent layouts, states, or animations.Do not hallucinate external library dependencies. Use only what is already present in package.json.RULE 3: PRIMITIVE COMPOSITIONComplex sections must be built by composing existing primitive components (Cards, Buttons, Inputs, Dialogs). Do not write raw HTML/Tailwind div structures for standard UI elements if a primitive exists.RULE 4: CREATION PROTOCOLIf—and only if—a component truly does not exist, build it as a modular, reusable primitive following the styling guidelines below, and place it in the appropriate shared directory.1. Typography (The "Academic Tech" Stack)The typography must balance the absolute authority of an examination body with the sleekness of a modern web application.Primary Heading Font: Plus Jakarta Sans (Usage: Hero sections, page titles, card headers).Secondary/Body Font: Inter (Usage: Quiz questions, instructions, navigation).Technical/Code Font: JetBrains Mono (Usage: System logs, timer displays, code snippets).Required CSS ImplementationCSS:root {
  --font-heading: 'Plus Jakarta Sans', sans-serif;
  --font-body: 'Inter', sans-serif;
  --font-mono: 'JetBrains Mono', monospace;
}
2. Color Palette (The "Midnight & Mint" Theme)Strictly utilize these design tokens. Do not introduce unapproved hex codes or arbitrary Tailwind color scales.TokenHex CodePurposeAgent InstructionPrimary#0F172ADeep NavyUse for main branding, trusted zones, primary buttons.Accent#10B981Emerald GreenUse ONLY for success states, final submissions, and "Start" actions.Warning#F59E0BAmberUse for time-low alerts, destructive-but-recoverable actions.Surface#F8FAFCOff-WhiteMandatory background for main exam interfaces to reduce eye strain.Border#E2E8F0Light GrayUse for subtle component separations.3. Component Styling MandatesAll components must adhere to a "light but sturdy" premium aesthetic.Borders: Enforce 1px solid var(--border). Never use heavy, dark borders.Radii: Enforce rounded-lg (0.5rem / 8px) globally for consistency. No completely sharp corners; no pill-shaped containers unless explicitly requested for badges.Shadows (Soft Depth): Apply this exact shadow for elevated elements, avoiding default harsh shadows.Allowed Tailwind: shadow-sm or a custom soft shadow equivalent to box-shadow: 0 4px 6px -1px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.05).4. "Midsem Mode" UI Specifics (Active Exam State)When rendering the active quiz interface, the agent must strictly enforce these rules:Maximum Focus: Render NO global navigation (headers/footers).Visible Elements Only: Display only the Timer, Progress Bar, Question Content, and Navigation/Submit controls.Tabular Timers: Any countdown timer MUST utilize font-mono or tabular-nums so the character widths remain static as seconds tick down.5. Iconography & CopywritingIcons: Strictly use the pre-installed icon library (e.g., lucide-react). Enforce a consistent stroke width (strokeWidth={1.5}). Do not mix icon weights.Copy: Enforce a premium, institutional tone.Allowed: "Proceed to Assessment", "Integrity Shield Active", "Connection Interrupted - Saving Locally".Prohibited: "Start Quiz", "Anti-cheat on", "Oops, you lost internet".
